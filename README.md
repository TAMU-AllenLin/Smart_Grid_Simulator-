# Smart Power Grid Simulation

A Python-based simulation of a smart electrical grid that models **energy generation**, **demand**, and **battery storage**.  
The system balances real-time supply and demand, tracks the battery's state of charge, logs performance metrics, and visualizes results through demand/generation plots.  
Built with modular components for generation, load, and storage models — making it easy to customize and expand.

## Features
- Simulates **renewable energy generation** and **grid demand** over time.
- Models **battery charging and discharging** with state-of-charge tracking.
- Automatically handles **energy deficits** and **surpluses**.
- Generates **performance logs** for analysis.
- Creates **visual plots** of demand, generation, battery charge, and unmet demand.
- Modular design (`generation_model.py`, `load_model.py`, etc.) for easy extension.
